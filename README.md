## Overview of Analysis
temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu,
The analysis is to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. This analysis was completed. Then W. Avy wanted the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. In order to complete this analyis I will be using Python, SQLAlchemy, and Flask, to analyze and visualize climate data. 

## Results
The results come from the SQLite data given to me from W. Avy. I queried the Measurements table for the temperatures and filtered for the month of June and December. I put the results in a list and made a dataframe for each month. Then I printed out a summary for each month.![June_temps](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86200136/131225076-d521e725-fbf0-40ad-8914-b06231347c7f.png)
